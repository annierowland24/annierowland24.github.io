            Leaving sensitive data unprotected can cause many different problems for a business as well as an individual. It can lead to a variety of different dangers, including:</br></br>
           <li> Passwords being cracked - sharing too much on social media is a form of sensitive data exposure as attackers can often find specific information that you have posted and crack your passwords out of that information.</li></br>
            <li>Data breaches - businesses can get in lots of trouble for this as it can involve attackers getting hold of confidential data they were trusted with. This can be expensive and damage their reputation.</li></br>
            <li>Stolen information - this could be bank details or credentials that get stolen, leading to difficulties immediately or later on.</li></br>
            
            Some solutions for this issue include:</br></br>
            
            <li>Encryption - encrypting your sensitive data makes it much harder for attackers to understand the data that they have gained, if they attack your device. This will ensure your sensitive data is kept safe and secure.</li></br>
            <li>Update your software - this will ensure any security holes have been filled, so attacks are less likely.</li></br>
            <li>Backup your data - this will protect you from losing any data if you are a victim to an attack.</li></br>
            <li>Install antivirus protection of your device - this will keep track of any malware or issues on your device, so you donâ€™t have to. </li></br>
            <li>Keep your passwords secure - ensure you keep updating your passwords to stronger passwords often, to prevent any attackers accessing your private data through means of hacking. </li>
