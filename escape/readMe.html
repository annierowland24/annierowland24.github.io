    <div class="body_txt"> Today, you’ve been touring a new office space that you’re considering using for your business. While you’re carefully inspecting the place, you hear a bang and a click.</br> </br>

        What was that? Was that door always closed? </br> </br>
        
        You go to open the door and it’s locked. It seems like there’s a keylock and some sort of combination padlock at the top of the door. You realise you don’t have either of these things. The owners of the office never told you anything about a code to get in and out, presumably the door was left propped open. </br> </br>
        
        You’ve seen a bulletin board with a note attached saying <b>'READ ME'</b>. </br> </br> Maybe that could help me in some way, you think to yourself.
