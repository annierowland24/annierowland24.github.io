            It’s a very common mistake to use the same password for several different websites. However secure you believe this password is, it only takes the hacker to access one of your passwords across the different sites and gain access to the rest. You should ensure you use a different password for each site, and each password should contain:</br>

          </br><li>Lower and uppercase letters.</li></br>
            <li>Punctuation and numbers.</li></br>
            <li>Numbers and words not specifically relevant to you, so your social media cannot be connected to it.</li></br>
            <li>At least 8-12 characters.</li></br>

            In order to keep your security at the maximum level, you should also invoke multi factor authentication. This will allow you to be notified when someone is trying to log into your account, as well as the log in having to pass more than one stage to gain access to the account.
