        Phishing emails use emails, texts, adverts and calls in order to trick their victims into giving personal information. This could include personal details and credentials, which may jeopardise the victims accounts. For example online banking and shopping. </br> </br>

        <b>What to look out for: </b></br> </br>

        In order to keep yourself safe from these attacks, you should take the steps to make sure you’re aware of some key things that come up a lot in these specific attacks.</br> </br>

        <b>Email addresses:</b></br></br>

        These could be ones that you don’t recognise form our address book and emails that also don’t match the sender name or title. For example, if you received an urgent email from PayPal asking for you to log in to your account, and the email address attached to it is not from the official PayPal email. </br> </br>

        You should also look out for email addresses that contain a bundle of letters and numbers, for example, hdfjshdjsf@gmail.com. This would be a disposable email address that is not linked to the person it’s from. </br></br>

        Another more subtle giveaway is emails from companies that still use a standard email domain name, for example @gmail.com or @hotmail.com. Most companies will create their own email domain for their business. While this is not a key giveaway, it’s certainly something to verify before handing over any personal information. </br></br>

        <b>Spelling and grammar:</b></br> </br>

        One of the most common tells for a phishing email is the spelling and punctuation mistakes that appear in the text. A legitimate company would not send out an email that was not immaculately typed. This is an effective, simple thing to check for if you’re unsure of the email. </br></br>

        <b>Links:</b></br> </br>

        Phishing emails will often have links and buttons in them for the victim to click on, which will often be the cause of the scam. These links can sometimes place malware onto your device which can open you up to a large amount of other cyber attacks. In other emails, the link can take you to a new website which asks for your personal details for any number of reasons. </br></br>

        You must ensure you are sure of the sender and the email before you click on any of these links. If you make your mouse hover over a link, it will display the link address it leads to in the bottom left corner. Check the address before clicking on the email to give yourself an extra bit of security.</br></br>

        <b>Urgency:</b></br></br>

        It is common for phishing emails to instruct you to do something urgently. This causes their victims to stress and panic which leads to mistakes being made and less precautions being taken. It is important to take your time and decide for yourself whether you think it is safe.</br></br>

        <b>If you find that you have opened a phishing scam email, you can take some simple steps in order to protect yourself, your information and your device. </br> These include:</b></br> </br>
        <li>Disconnect from your internet. This will cut off your device from an attacker.</li></br>
        <li>Backup your device - this will eliminate the chance of losing any files or information stored on your device.</li></br>
        <li>Reset your passwords - this will prevent an attacker from being able to log into any of the accounts they have gained credentials for.</li></br>
        <li>Report the email via the National Cyber Security Centre website - this will alert security experts of this scam. </li> </br>
