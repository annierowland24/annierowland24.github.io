<!--------------------Text------------------------------>

<div class="body_txt"> For your second task, you must crack Andrew Stuart's Microsoft Teams password. 
    It seems like a logical place to look for a digit to the door code, maybe he's had to send it to a colleague that's forgotten it at some point.</br>
    You must look through the various social media pages that have been left open on the unlocked phone you've picked up. It would be a good idea to refer back to the Microsoft Teams
    page, it seems like Andrew has set up some prompts to help him remember his password. </br> </br>
    How foolish of him. </br> </br>
    Once you think you've cracked it. Click the 'I've cracked Andrew's password' button at the top of the page to test it.</br> </br>
    Good Luck.
